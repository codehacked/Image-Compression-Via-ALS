# Image-Compression-Via-ALS
It involves using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) for compressing images, comparing its effectiveness with ALS combined with QR factorization and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The ALS method iteratively optimizes the approximation of an image by minimizing reconstruction error. The ALS + QR factorization approach enhances this by incorporating QR factorization for better accuracy in approximating image matrices. The SVD method further refines the compression by decomposing the image matrix into singular values and vectors, providing a compact representation while preserving essential image features. The comparison evaluates the performance of these techniques in terms of compression efficiency and image quality.
